req.body holds parameters that are sent up from the client as part of a POST request. 

body-parser parses your request and converts it into a format from which you can easily extract relevant information that you may need.
For example, let’s say you have a sign-up form at your frontend. You are filling it, and requesting server to save the details somewhere.

Extracting username and password from your request goes as simple as below if you use body-parser.
…………………………………………………….
var loginDetails = {
username : request.body.username,
password : request.body.password
};
…………………………………………………….
So basically, body-parser parsed your incoming request, assembled the chunks containing your form data, then created this body object for you and filled it with your form data.
And you just used it.
